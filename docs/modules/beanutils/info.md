# BeanUtils Tutorial

## _Description_

Java Bean Mapper is part of the Apache Commons BeanUtils library from the Apache Software Foundation. This project provides useful tools around the standard JavaBeans Component API with reflection-based _java.beans.Introspector_ mechanism of mapping. The mapping under the hood is provided by the _org.apache.commons.beanutils.BeanUtils_ class. Can only be used for simple and not profound mappings.
