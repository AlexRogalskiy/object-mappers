# JMapper

## Description

JMapper object-mapping framework is similar to MapStruct configuration mechanism that should be provided beforehand.
Several configuration variants cab be supported:
- XML-based
- annotation-based
- programmatic configuration via Java API

Uses the bytecode generation mechanism based on Javassist library to provide end-to-end mappings.

## Features

- relational mapping of several classes to one class (many to one) and vice versa (one to many)
- configurations inheritance

## Pros & Cons

### Pros

- high performance due to bytecode generation mechanism (Javassist library)
- easy-to-use feature mappings

### Cons

- hard to debug and validate object mappings correctness

## Use cases
