# JMapper Tutorial

## _Description_

JMapper object-mapping framework is similar to MapStruct configuration mechanism that should be provided beforehand. Several configuration variants cab be supported:

* XML-based
* annotation-based
* programmatic configuration via Java API

Uses the bytecode generation mechanism based on Javassist library to provide end-to-end mappings.

## _Features_

* relational mapping of several classes to one class \(many to one\) and vice versa \(one to many\)
* configurations inheritance

## _Pros & Cons_

### _Pros_

* high performance due to bytecode generation mechanism \(Javassist library\)
* easy-to-use feature mappings

### _Cons_

* hard to debug and validate object mappings correctness

## _Use cases_
